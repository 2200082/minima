So now we have reached the end of my little guide on digital identities and existential risks. I hope you now have an easier and better understanding of the topic and have an overview of how these topics are connected and correlate with each other. 
<br><br>
If you still have questions, feel free to contact me via the following channels:
-	Instagram:
-	LinkedIn:
-	Twitter: ...
<a/>
If you like, you are also very welcome to leave feedback! <br>
I am open to constructive criticism, suggestions for improvement and other views, as I think this is a topic that can be better understood through discourse.
<br><br>
In Step 6, I have once again linked my references and further links so that, if you have the time and the inclination, you can look into the subject in more detail. Also linked are the websites of my fellow students who were also part of the project and may have been able to gather completely different views or insights.
<br><br>
I wish you all the best & see you soon! <br>
Hannah
