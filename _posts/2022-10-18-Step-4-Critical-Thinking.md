We have now created a good basis for taking a closer look at how the existential risks just explained are connected to our personal digital identities. Basically, it can be said that with our digital identities we always make a contribution in the form of an opinion in a post or comment or even consciously by publishing certain contributions in a targeted form. The extent to which this now affects individual existential risks will now be examined in more detail.

A fellow student, Ayah, has examined the connection between digital identities and the existential risks of "climate change" and "wars". [LINK] She found out that ... . If you would like to learn more about this, please visit her website. :)

Another fellow student, Gregozs, studied the connection between digital identities and "Artificial Intelligence". He found out that... Again, if you want to learn more about this, take a look at his website. :)

But, as explained, there are some more, maybe not that obvious existential risks. As my fellow students has already taken a closer look to the biggest ones, I now want to have a closer look at the less obvious existential risks and how they are connected to our digital identities.

...
##### How are Digital Identities and the Existential Risk of “Naturally occurring existential threats e.g. asteroids” connected?
