Now that we have collected all the necessary basics for an understanding of digital identities, we can deal with the definition of the term digital identities.<br>
There are various definitions for this and I don’t want to commit to one a specific one, so here are some that I think are providing a good understanding of the term.
<br>
<br>
> “A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization or electronic device that exists online. Unique identifiers and use patterns make it possible to detect individuals or their devices.” - **techtarget.com** <br><br>
> “A digital identity is information used by computer systems to represent an external agent – a person, organization, application, or device.” - **Wikipedia.org** <br><br>
> “Digital identity is essentially any personal data existing online that can be traced back to the real you. For example, photos you've uploaded to social media, posts you've created or commented on, your online bank account, search engine history.” - **blog.avast.com** <br><br>
> “A digital identity is a way to prove your identity in a safe and secure way when accessing services or completing transactions online. A digital identity removes the need to prove your identity through face-to-face interactions and by using physical identity documents.” - ***nsw.gov.au*** <br><br>
> “A digital identity is an online or networked likeness that an individual, organization, or electronic device adopts or claims in cyberspace. Through several communities, users can project more than one digital persona. However, security and privacy are major concerns when it comes to digital identity management.” - **imageware.io**


<br> <br>
In summary you can say that…
<br> <br>
People’s Digital Identities consist out of three elements: (miteksystems.com)<br>
-	**Existence** — Users must have an independent existence.
-	**Control** — Users must control their identities.
-	**Access** — Users must have access to their own data and any associated claims without the interference of gatekeepers or intermediaries.
